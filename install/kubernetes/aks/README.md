# Microcks to AKS

This allows deployment of the configuration to AKS.

## Config details
This configuration has been derived from the install/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml
The yml file has been transformed to kubernetes configuration with the help of the utility 'kompose' and the files have been altered to deploy a version (with keycloak disabled) to AKS successfully
